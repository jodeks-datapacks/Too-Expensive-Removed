If you encounter this issue, here is a step by step guide on how to enable Cheats/Admincommands permanently after you have already created a Minecraft world.

  <summary>How to Install a Mod on a Minecraft Server</summary>

### Step-by-Step Guide to Installing a Mod on a Minecraft Server

1. **Download the Mod**  
   - Make sure to download the **correct version** of the Mod that matches your server's Minecraft version.
   - **Important:** The mod file should be a `.jar` file.

2. **Ensure No Datapacks or Other Mods Conflict**  
   - Do not have both a datapack and a mod installed at the same time, as they may conflict.
   - Only install one or the other, depending on your server's setup.

3. **Locate the Mods Folder**  
   - Open your server's root directory.
   - Inside this directory, find the folder named `mods`.  
   - If the `mods` folder doesn't exist, create one.

4. **Install the Mod**  
   - Paste the downloaded `.jar` file for the Mod into the `mods` folder.

5. **Restart the Server**  
   - After adding the Mod to the `mods` folder, restart your Minecraft server for the mod to be activated.

6. **Verify Mod Installation**  
   - Once the server has restarted, join the server and check if the Mod is working.
   - You can use `/mods` or a similar command (depending on the mod) to see if the Mod has been successfully loaded.

### Additional Tips
- **Backup Your Server:** Always create a backup before installing the Mod to avoid data loss in case something goes wrong.
- **Ensure Mod Compatibility:** Check that the Mod is compatible with your Minecraft server version and any other mods you have installed.
